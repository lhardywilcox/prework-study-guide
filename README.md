# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A bootcamp prework study guide for students.

This project provides a study guide for bootcamp students, as a way to build a personal notebook,and practice using HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript in an introductory project.  It provides the learner with hands-on application and allows solidification of newly learned skills.

I learned, through this project, about navigating the Command Line, creating and using a Git repository, building HTML codes, using CSS, and a simple Javascript file.
